Vertex is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange with MetaMask pairing, live smart contract data fetching, and the ability to swap ERC20 tokens on the Goerli Testnet. 

## Prerequisites
MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet
<br>
<br>
**If user desires to swap cryptocurrencies, they will need a balance of WETH on the Goerli Testnet**

## Instructions
**To set up a local copy, follow these simple steps:**  
```
1. git clon https://github.com/jscoding10/vertex-decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange.git
2. cd vertex-decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-main
3. npm install  
4. npm run react-app:start
```
The local copy of Vertex runs on localhost:3000. 
<br>
<br>
**The deployed version of Vertex can be found at:** https://vertex-decentralized-crypto-exchange.netlify.app/
<br>
<br>
**How to use Vertex Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange**
1. Install and run Vertex on localhost:3000 or use the deployed version found at the link above.
2. Click the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner.
3. Choose which account to connect in the MetaMask popup window. Vertex should show the wallet address where the "Connect Wallet" button was if wallet connection is successful.
4. Select the token to be swapped and enter the amount. Vertex should show the current balance of the selected token in the MetaMask wallet.
5. Select which token from the trading pairs the token in Step 4 will be swapped for. Vertex should show how much of the token will be received.
6. Click the "Approve" button on the bottom and approve the transaction in the MetaMask popup window. 
7. Vertex will display a message depending upon if the swap if successful or not.

## Lessons Learned


## Improvements











This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

## Project Structure

The default template is a monorepo created with [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

Workspaces makes it possible to setup multiple packages in such a way that we only need to run `yarn install` once to install all of them in
a single pass. Dependencies are hoisted at the root.

Owing to this dependency on Yarn Workspaces, Create Eth App can't be used with npm.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### React App

#### `yarn react-app:start`

Runs the React app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

#### `yarn react-app:test`

Runs the React test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

[Read more about testing React.](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)

#### `yarn react-app:build`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the React documentation on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `yarn react-app:eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `react-app:eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` the React app at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your React package.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right
into the `react-app` package so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `react-app:eject` will still work,
but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `react-app:eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Subgraph

The Graph is a tool for for indexing events emitted on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides you with an easy-to-use GraphQL API. <br/>

To learn more, check out the [The Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs).

#### `yarn subgraph:codegen`

Generates AssemblyScript types for smart contract ABIs and the subgraph schema.

#### `yarn subgraph:build`

Compiles the subgraph to WebAssembly.

#### `yarn subgraph:auth`

Before deploying your subgraph, you need to sign up on the
[Graph Explorer](https://thegraph.com/explorer/). There, you will be given an access token. Drop it in the command
below:

```sh
GRAPH_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-access-token-here yarn subgraph:auth
```

#### `yarn subgraph:deploy`

Deploys the subgraph to the official Graph Node.<br/>

Replace `paulrberg/create-eth-app` in the package.json script with your subgraph's name.
